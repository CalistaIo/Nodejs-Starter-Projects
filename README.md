## Task Manager app (task-manager folder)

The Task Manager app consists of a REST API that allows for basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations to be performed on tasks owned by a user. Users can create an
account using their name, email, and password. From there, they can log in using their email and password, and start creating tasks. The app uses MongoDB for user and task data
storage. Mongoose is used for modelling and managing the relationships between task and user objects.
